# ðŸš² Bike Sharing Demand Prediction using Decision Tree Regressor from scratch

This project implements a Decision Tree Regressor from scratch and applies it to the popular Bike Sharing Dataset. The goal is to predict the number of bikes rented based on environmental and seasonal features.

Insights:

The model explains 64% of the variance in bike rental demand.

Predictions are off by about 106 bikes on average.

Future Improvements

    Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split)

    Feature engineering (e.g., seasonal effects, interactions)

    Ensemble models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

    Cross-validation for more robust evaluation
